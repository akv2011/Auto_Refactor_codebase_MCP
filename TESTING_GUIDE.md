## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Restart VS Code
After updating `.vscode/mcp.json`, restart VS Code to load the new MCP server configuration.

### Step 2: Verify Server is Running
Open the **MCP Output Panel** in VS Code to confirm the `auto-refactor` server started successfully.

List all refactoring suggestions that haven't been applied yet
```
**Expected:** List of suggestions with IDs, file paths, strategies, and priorities.

---

### üîü Approve/Reject Suggestions
**Prompt:**
```
Approve the suggestion sug_456def
```
**Alternative:**

```
**Expected:** Suggestion status updated, ready for application or archived.

---

## üéØ End-to-End Test Scenario

**Complete Workflow Prompt:**
```
I want to refactor my src/ directory:
1. First scan for files that need refactoring
2. Then get AI suggestions for the top 3 most complex files
3. Show me the suggestions and let me pick one to apply
4. Execute the chosen refactoring
5. Show me the operation history
```

---

## üîß Advanced Testing Prompts

### Test with Configuration
**Prompt:**
```
Scan files using these thresholds: max 500 lines, max 20 functions, max complexity 10
```

### Test Safety Features
**Prompt:**
```
Refactor src/metrics_engine.py but ensure tests pass before committing changes
```

### Test Git Integration
**Prompt:**
```
Create a backup branch before refactoring src/scanner.py
```

### Test Rollback
**Prompt:**
```
Something went wrong with the last refactoring - rollback to the previous version
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Test Prompts

### Check Server Status
**Prompt:**
```
Is the auto-refactor MCP server running? Show me its status
```

### Verify Tools Available
**Prompt:**
```
What tools are available from the auto-refactor server?
```

### Test Error Handling
**Prompt:**
```
Try to refactor a non-existent file: src/does_not_exist.py
```
**Expected:** Error message explaining file not found.

## üìä Expected Response Patterns

### Successful Operation
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "operation_id": "op_abc123",
  "message": "Refactoring completed successfully",
  "details": {
    "file": "src/example.py",
    "operation": "extract_function",
    "backup_branch": "refactor-backup-20251008-120000"
  }
}
```

### Failed Operation
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Tests failed after refactoring",
  "message": "Rolled back changes automatically",
  "details": {
    "test_output": "..."
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After each test, verify:
- [ ] Server responded without errors
- [ ] Response contains expected data
- [ ] Files were modified correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests still pass: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Git backup branch created (for refactoring operations)
- [ ] `.taskmaster/` directory contains operation history

---

## üéì Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Test `hello_refactor` first to confirm server connectivity
2. **Check History:** Always review `get_refactoring_status` after operations
3. **Safety First:** Let the server run tests automatically - don't skip them
4. **Rollback Ready:** Keep operation IDs handy for quick rollbacks
5. **Use Dry Run:** For complex refactorings, ask for suggestions before applying

## üìù Sample Test Session

```
You: "Test the auto-refactor server"
AI: "‚úÖ Server is running - auto-refactor v0.1.0"

You: "Scan src/ directory for refactoring candidates"
AI: "Found 3 files exceeding thresholds:
     - src/database_refactoring.py (450 lines, complexity: 18)
     - src/codebase_analyzer.py (520 lines, 35 functions)
     - src/config_loader.py (380 lines, complexity: 16)"

You: "Get suggestions for src/database_refactoring.py"
AI: "Generated 3 refactoring suggestions:
     1. Extract _split_sql_statements into separate file
     2. Reduce cyclomatic complexity in split_migration
     3. Split class into DatabaseSQLRefactor and DatabaseDjangoRefactor"

You: "Apply suggestion 1"
AI: "‚úÖ Extracted function successfully
     - Created: src/sql_splitter.py
     - Modified: src/database_refactoring.py
     - Tests: All passing ‚úÖ
     - Backup: refactor-backup-20251008-143022"

You: "Show refactoring history"
AI: "Recent operations:
     1. extract_function (2 min ago) - SUCCESS
     2. split_migration (1 hour ago) - SUCCESS
     3. reduce_complexity (2 hours ago) - ROLLED_BACK"
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **API Keys Required:** Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in `.vscode/mcp.json`
2. **Git Repository:** Server works best in a git repository for backup/rollback features
3. **Test Suite:** Keep your test suite updated for automatic validation
4. **Backup First:** Server creates automatic backups, but manual git commits are recommended before major refactorings

Happy Testing! üéâ
